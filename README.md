This is an AI made for kids




Aren't you tired of your kids cheating on homework with ChatGPT? If you use this AI it can stop kids from cheating in homework because it teaches them how to do things instead of a direct answer, 
it wil guide your kid through tough concepts and help your kid understand anything your kid donsn't understand. It is a supportive and helpful AI that can encourage the kid even when the kid made a wrong answer.






Recent updates:
Added a health check.
Added a gif as a joke.
Added a bug fix where the ai after hearing the wrong answer will tell the correct answer.
